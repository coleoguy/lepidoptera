One small project would be to simply apply our split rate model to the data set that 
Otto and Hardy used.  Do species with restricted feeding show higher rates of chromosome
evolution?  Another option would be to get together all the data that we can here is
a good start on it.  Then bounce this data through phylota and make the biggest tree 
that we can for lepidoptera chromosome number.

If we went that route then we could do tests like:
1) is there general rate variation
2) is there evidence for polyploidization
3) does being XO lead to higher rate of chrom num reduction?

4) this would be natural chapter then chapter on diptera and chapter on XXX and synthesis
as well.
